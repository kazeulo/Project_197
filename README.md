# palAI & mAIs: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Forecasting Palay and Corn Production in Region VI (Western Visayas)

This repository contains the code and files for our **CMSC197** final mini project.

### Project Overview
This project aims to explore and implement **six machine learning algorithms** to forecast **palay (rice)** and **corn production** in the **five provinces** of **Western Visayas, Philippines**. The following algorithms are implemented and evaluated:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict the future production of palay and corn in Western Visayas to assist in agricultural planning, policy-making, and resource management. By using historical data, the machine learning models aim to provide accurate forecasts to help local governments and agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions.

### Objectives

The general objective of this study is to identify the optimal crop type/s to be planted in specific quarters by predicting the volume of production for palay and corn across different provinces of Western Visayas, Philippines. Specifically, this project aims to:

- Investigate the historical production volumes of palay and corn across different provinces in Western Visayas and quarters from 1987 to 2024 to identify trends and patterns.
- Utilize machine learning models—specifically linear regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, k-nearest neighbor, XGboost, and artificial neural network—to predict future crop production based on historical data
- Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the different machine learning models in forecasting crop production, using appropriate performance metrics.

### Data Description
The data used in this project includes historical records of **palay** and **corn production** in the five provinces of Western Visayas (Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Guimaras, and Iloilo). The dataset contains information on area harvested and volume of productions, along with the corresponding time.
